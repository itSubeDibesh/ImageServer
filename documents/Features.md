## PasswordAnalyzer

features as minimum:

- A user interface to prompt a user to create an account by providing username and password.
- Algorithmically determine the strength of the chosen password by the user.

Your prototype and prototype design should illustrate and embed good secure system design and apply appropriate cybersecurity principles and techniques showing your understanding and knowledge of secure system design. Where appropriate, you should make use of robust policies and procedures for password ‚Äì for example (but not limited to) frequency of change, strength of password, preventing repetition of passwords, use of encryption etc.
